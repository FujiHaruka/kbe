  en: A [persistent volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) (PV) is a cluster-wide resource that you can use to store data in a way that it persists beyond the lifetime of a pod. The PV is not backed by locally-attached storage on a worker node but by networked storage system such as EBS or NFS or a distributed filesystem like Ceph.

texts:
  en: "In order to use a PV you need to claim it first, using a persistent volume claim (PVC). The PVC requests a PV with your desired specification (size, speed, etc.) from Kubernetes and binds it then to a pod where you can mount it as a volume. So let's create such a [PVC](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/master/specs/pv/pvc.yaml), asking Kubernetes for 1 GB of storage using the default [storage class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/):"

  en: "Note that the default behavior is that even when the deployment is deleted, the PVC (and the PV) continues to exist. This storage protection feature helps avoiding data loss. Once you're sure you don't need the data anymore, you can go ahead and delete the PVC and with it eventually destroy the PV:"
