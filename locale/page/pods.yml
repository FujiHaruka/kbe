    A pod is a collection of containers sharing a network and mount namespace

    and is the basic unit of deployment in Kubernetes. All containers in a pod

    are scheduled on the same node.

    To launch a pod using the container [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mhausenblas/simpleservice/)

    `mhausenblas/simpleservice:0.5.0` and exposing a HTTP API on port `9876`, execute:

    From within the cluster (e.g. via `minishift ssh`) this pod is accessible via the pod IP `172.17.0.3`,

    which we've learned from the `kubectl describe` command above:

    Note that `kubectl run` creates a [deployment](/deployments/), so in order to

    get rid of the pod you have to execute `kubectl delete deployment sise`.

    You can also create a pod from a configuration file.

    In this case the [pod](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/master/specs/pods/pod.yaml) is

    running the already known `simpleservice` image from above along with

    a generic `CentOS` container:

    Now we can exec into the `CentOS` container and access the `simpleservice`

    on localhost:

    Specify the `resources` field in the pod to influence how much CPU and/or RAM a

    container in a [pod](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/master/specs/pods/constraint-pod.yaml)

    can use (here: `64MB` of RAM and `0.5` CPUs):

    To sum up, launching one or more containers (together) in Kubernetes is simple,

    however doing it directly as shown above comes with a serious limitation: you have to

    manually take care of keeping them running in case of a failure. A better way

    to supervise pods is to use [deployments](/deployments), giving you much more control over the life cycle, including rolling out a new version.
