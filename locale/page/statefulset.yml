However, for a stateful app you might want to use a [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/). Unlike a deployment, the `StatefulSet` provides certain guarantees about the identity of the pods it is managing (that is, predictable names) and about the startup order. Two more things that are different compared to a deployment: for network communication you need to create a [headless services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services) and for persistency the `StatefulSet` manages a [persistent volume](/pv) per pod."

  en: Note that sometimes a `StatefulSet` is not the best fit for your stateful app. You might be better off defining a [custom resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) along with writing a custom controller to have finer-grained control over your workload.
