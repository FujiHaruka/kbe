    Logging is one option to understand what is going on inside your applications

    and the cluster at large. Basic logging in Kubernetes makes the output a

    container produces available, which is a good use case for debugging. More advanced

    [setups](http://some.ops4devs.info/logging/) consider logs across nodes and store

    them in a central place, either within the cluster or via a dedicated (cloud-based) service.

    Let's create a [pod](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/master/specs/logging/pod.yaml)

    called `logme` that runs a container writing to `stdout` and `stderr`:

    To view the five most recent log lines of the `gen` container in the `logme` pod,

    execute:

    Note that if you wouldn't have specified `--since=10s` in the above command, you

    would have gotten all log lines from the start of the container.

    You can also view logs of pods that have already completed their lifecycle.

    For this we create a [pod](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/master/specs/logging/oneshotpod.yaml)

    called `oneshot` that counts down from 9 to 1 and then exits. Using the `-p` option

    you can print the logs for previous instances of the container in a pod:
