    Namespaces provide for a scope of Kubernetes resource, carving up your cluster in smaller units. You can think of it

    as a workspace you're sharing with other users. Many resources such as pods and

    services are namespaced, while some, for example, nodes are not namespaced (but cluster-wide). As a developer you'd usually use an assigned namespace, however admins may wish to manage them, for example to set up access control or resource quotas.

    Let's list all namespaces (note that the output will depend on the environment

    you're using, I'm using [Minishift](/diy/) here):

    Let's now create a new [namespace](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/master/specs/ns/ns.yaml)

    called `test` now:

    To launch a [pod](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/master/specs/ns/pod.yaml) in

    the newly created namespace `test`, do:

    Note that using above method the namespace becomes a runtime property, that is,

    you can deploy the same pod or service, etc. into multiple

    namespaces (for example: `dev` and `prod`). Hard-coding the

    namespace directly in the `metadata` section like shown in the following is possible but causes less flexibility when deploying your apps:

    If you're an admin, you might want to check out the [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/namespaces/)

    for more info how to handle namespaces.
