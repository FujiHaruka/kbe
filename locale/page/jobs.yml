    A [job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/) in Kubernetes is a supervisor for pods carrying out batch processes, that is,

    a process that runs for a certain time to completion, for example a calculation

    or a backup operation.

    Note that there are also more advanced ways to use jobs, for example,

    by utilizing a [work queue](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/job/coarse-parallel-processing-work-queue/)

    or scheduling the execution at a certain time via [cron jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/).
